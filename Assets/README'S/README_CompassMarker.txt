Making an object show on the compass

Step 1. Add the CompassMarker component to the object that you wish to show up on the compass.

Step 2. Make a new scriptable object for the compass marker.
 Assets->ScriptableObjects->CompassMarker->Right click-> Create -> CompassMarker

Step 3. Assign the sprite you wish to represent this object in the "Compass Marker Sprite" slot in the inspector.

Step 4. Assign a scale for the compass marker. By default, it should be 100x100. This may be too big for a specific sprite.

Step 5. Assign the newly created scriptable object in the CompassMarker component on your object.

Step 6. Ensure that the compass marker size is correct. This may take a few times to dial in.
