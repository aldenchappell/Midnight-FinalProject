Making a customized location for a pickup

Step 1. Go to Assets->ScriptableObjects->ObjectHolding and determine what size you want to use for this object.
Note: You probably won't have to make a new one of these.

Step 2. On the object that gets picked up, add the ObjectSize component.

Step 3. Depending on the size of the object, assign one of the objectsize scriptable objects in the inspector.

Step 4. If the object is relatively small, you don't need to worry about these steps. The default setting for the object
size is small.
