  noteText: ' Canto IV:  "We had not made our way so far within, When I perceived
    a flame had overcome A hemisphere of darkness. We were yet A little distant from
    it, but not so far, That I discerned not in part that honourable People held
    that place. O thou who honourest Every art and science, who are these, That have
    such honour, it would do thee honour to know them?" And he to me: "The honourable
    name, That sounds of them above there in thy life, Wins grace in Heaven, that
    so advances them."'
