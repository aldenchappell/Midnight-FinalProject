  noteText: "Dear Investigator,  There is a collection of Polaroid pictures hidden
    across the rooms, each containing fragments of a larger image. This puzzle seems
    to be meticulously arranged, and solving it may reveal crucial information. Pay
    close attention to the details in each photograph. There are subtle clues hidden
    within the images\u2014symbols, landmarks, or even numbers\u2014that could guide
    you toward the bigger picture. Once assembled, this Polaroid mosaic may uncover
    a significant revelation. Handle the pieces with care, and let your keen eye
    for detail lead you to the truth. Good luck.  Sincerely, A Friend"
