  noteText: ' Dante''s Inferno is the first part of his epic poem The Divine Comedy,
    which describes the poet''s journey through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil.
    In Inferno, Hell is depicted as a series of nine concentric circles, each representing
    a different sin and its corresponding punishment. The circles descend in severity
    from the outermost to the innermost. The first circle, Limbo, is for the unbaptized
    and virtuous pagans who are not punished but are deprived of the vision of God.
    The second circle is for the lustful, punished by being blown about by strong
    winds. The third circle is for the gluttonous, who are forced to lie in a vile
    slush produced by ceaseless foul rain. The fourth circle houses the greedy and
    wasteful, who push heavy weights against each other, symbolizing their selfish
    drive for fortune. The fifth circle contains the wrathful, who fight each other
    on the surface of the river Styx, and the sullen, who lie gurgling beneath the
    water. The sixth circle is for heretics, trapped in flaming tombs. The seventh
    circle, divided into three rings, is for the violent: those who committed violence
    against others, against themselves (suicides), and against God (blasphemers,
    sodomites, and usurers). The eighth circle, called Malebolge, is for fraudsters,
    subdivided into ten bolgias or ditches, each for different types of fraud. Finally,
    the ninth circle, Cocytus, is for traitors, who are frozen in an icy lake, with
    the worst offenders, such as Judas Iscariot, Brutus, and Cassius, being chewed
    eternally by Lucifer himself. Through this vivid and intricate structure, Dante
    explores themes of justice, retribution, and the moral order of the universe.'
