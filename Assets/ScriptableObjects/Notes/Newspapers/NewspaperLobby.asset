  noteText: Tragic Blaze Engulfs Brimstone Hotel June 29, 1939  A devastating fire
    consumed the historic Brimstone Hotel late last night, resulting in tragic loss
    and severe damage. Firefighters battled the intense blaze for hours, but the
    inferno left little more than charred remains of the once-iconic structure. 
    The fire broke out around midnight, with initial reports suggesting a potential
    electrical fault as the cause. Guests and staff were evacuated, but sadly, several
    lives were lost, and many more were injured in the chaos. Emergency services
    have yet to confirm the final casualty count.  Witnesses described scenes of
    panic and heroism as rescuers rushed to save those trapped inside. "It was like
    a nightmare," said one survivor. "The smoke was so thick, and the flames spread
    so quickly."  The Brimstone Hotel, a landmark known for its vintage charm and
    storied history, now stands in ruins. City officials have pledged a thorough
    investigation into the tragedy while the community mourns this heartbreaking
    loss.
