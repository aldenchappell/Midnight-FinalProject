  - Sorry I cant leave yet, please fix the picture of my family for me I cant remember
    how it's suppose to look.
  - I also don't remember where I put the ball to my maze. I still need to finish
    that, I somehow always get lost in it.
  - ........Wait who are you again?......
  - .........
  - Oh, I almost forgot, I also need you to find my family Polaroid photos. They
    help me remember my life but it seems I've lost them all.
